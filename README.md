# Java Uncommon Bug: ArithmeticException

This repository demonstrates a simple yet potentially problematic bug in Java: an `ArithmeticException` resulting from integer division by zero.  The code attempts to divide an integer by zero, leading to a runtime exception.

The `UncommonBug.java` file contains the buggy code. The `UncommonBugSolution.java` file presents a solution to handle the potential division by zero using appropriate checks.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Java applications, especially when dealing with potentially invalid inputs.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile and run `UncommonBug.java` to observe the `ArithmeticException`.
3. Compile and run `UncommonBugSolution.java` to see the corrected and safer version.
